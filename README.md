Can macroeconomic signals predict cross-sectional stock returns? 

This proof-of-concept replicates and extends Macrosynergy Academy studies on macro-driven relative value equity strategies, testing whether macroeconomic indicators contain predictive power for next-period stock excess returns beyond traditional factors.

Project Scope

- Universe: 21 U.S. stocks from 11 GICS sectors
- Data: Bloomberg, FRED
- Period: 1993-2025 (30+ years)
- Models: OLS, LASSO, SUR, SUR_TW, Random Forest

This study aims to generate predictive signals from these macroeconomic models and construct portfolios to rigorously evaluate backtested performance and economic significance.
